# UI Refresh General Architecture 

<!-- Date -->
*2021-10-19*

<!-- Summary -->
The new UI refresh needed basic decisions around infrastructure. Typescript/React was the framework desired. State management was also discussed; Redux was chosen due to it's focus on app-level state, and it's popularity. This ADR covers the architectural decisions made to support those frameworks.

## Status <!-- Status of this ADR -->
Accepted

## Alternatives Considered <!-- Short list of considered alternatives, should include the chosen path -->
- Create React App (CRA)
- Manual React Setup
- Other react bootstraping solutions

## Decision Outcome <!-- Summary of the decision -->
Create React App (CRA) was chosen to bootstrap the repo. The typescript template will be used, and redux added post-hoc.

## Consequences <!-- Summary of the decision -->
Using CRA allows fast initial setup, but adds some "magic" to the repo. We felt this was a good tradeoff for initial development. CRA also offers `eject`[^1] which allows for it to be removed as a dependancy (though doing so also removes many of it's benefits, such as not maintaining the webpack config). There is also a large dev community for CRA. 

## Pros and Cons of the Alternatives <!-- List Pros/Cons of each considered alternative -->

### Create React App (CRA)
- `+` Fast and easy setup
- `+` Large dev community, with existing tools and documentation
- `-` Low flexibility (if we run into a unique react issue we need to solve, we may need to `eject`[^1])
- `+` Low flexibility (allows us to focus more on development over bikeshedding)

### Manual React Setup
- `+` Almost completely customizable
- `-` Complicated configurations and decisions around bundling, css loading, etc. Best practices unclear.
- `-` Would be KBase-specific, and perhaps even repo-specfic, adding to required onboarding.

### Other react app-bootstrapping solutions
- `+` Some, such as Snowpack, have faster and/or more intuitive setup
- `-` Smaller dev community
- `-` may not have long-term viability
